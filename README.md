🌿 Plant Disease Identification Using Machine Learning

A web-based machine learning application to detect plant diseases from leaf images using a Streamlit-powered user interface.

🧠 Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to identify plant diseases from leaf images. Users can upload a photo of a leaf, and the model predicts the type of disease (if any). The frontend is built using Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use portal for farmers, gardeners, and researchers.

🔍 Features
📸 Upload leaf images for diagnosis

🧠 CNN-based machine learning model for classification

🌐 Streamlit web portal for fast and interactive predictions

📊 Confidence scores for predictions


🛠️ Installation
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-identification.git
cd plant-disease-identification
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app/app.py
🧪 Model Info
The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, containing over 50,000 labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. The current version uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with TensorFlow/Keras.

You can modify or retrain the model using the train_model.ipynb notebook.

🖼️ Example Output

Input Image	Predicted Disease	Confidence
Tomato Late Blight	98.7%
Healthy	95.1%
✅ TODO
 Add multilingual support

 Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces

 Integrate model explainability with Grad-CAM
